# Project summary
Project is inspired by this [reel](https://www.instagram.com/p/CpiGuJ1O5pL/).  
This is a lighhearted project not indended as anything.  

## Purpose
I made it to practice using css and manipulating the DOM with javascript

## Experience gained
Although this is a joke project, it uses a non-trivial amount of technologies; I had to use multiple _**CSS**_ properties, _**events**_ and _**event handlers**_ from javascript, and _**DOM manipulation**_.

## How to run
To run this project, download all the files, unpack them, amd simply open `home.html` with your preferred browser.
